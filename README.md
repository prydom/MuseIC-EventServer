MuseIC-EventServer
==================

An event server written in Python that translates raw OSC events into higher level events (as an example, to control an embedded YouTube player). For use with the [Muse-IO](https://sites.google.com/a/interaxon.ca/muse-developer-site/museio) client.

This is a **winning** submission for the *[Hack the North](http://hackthenorth.com/) 2014* Hackathon held this September at the University of Waterloo.
